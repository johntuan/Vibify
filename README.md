About this application
The Jamming Project is a Spotify utility program that was completed through the Codecademy program for Web Development. It is meant to serve as a case study on fully developing a React application and implementing API's.

The API has been removed from the code and thus will no longer work. If you'd like to test it for yourself you must add your own key which can be obtained by following the instruction provided here: https://developer.spotify.com/. Any further development was outside of the current scope of this project.

Run this app locally
If you wish to test the app for yourself you must run it locally as long as you have your own API key as stated above. This can be done by creating a clone of the project and entering your API key in the Spotify.js file where it says 'clientAPI' on line 1. Once these conditions have been met type 'npm start' into the console to start the app on the local host.

Functionality overview
In this application, users may conduct searches for certain tracks, artists, or albums from Spotify's database. Users can then create and modify playlists to add to their own Spotify account. Avaliable functions include adding a song to a playlist using the '+' symbol next to the desired track, removing tracks or playlists using the '-' symbol next to the unwanted item, and renaming playlists by updating the name above the desired playlist.
